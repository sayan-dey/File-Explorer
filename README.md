#  File Explorer

* I have made multiple CPP files for ease of understanding and debugging. 
* I have also created "makefile" for executing all those files at once.
* On compiling and running "main.cpp", ```make``` command and the final executable file will get automatically executed.
* So, to start, just execute ```g++ main.cpp``` and ```./a.out```.

* It's better to complete all operations of normal mode and then switch to command mode.
* If some error message comes in status bar in command mode, it'll automatically be removed after the user enters any character.
